# protoc-gen-persist

[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/tcncloud/protoc-gen-persist.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/tcncloud/protoc-gen-persist)

Protobuf plugin that generate a persistence layer backed by SQL or Spanner database


## Rationale
An opinionated protoc plugin that will help generate boiler plate go code for GRPC micro services projects that need to interact with a SQL or Spanner database.
The code generation is accomplished by providing a protobuf file with proper annotations, and then running the protoc cli tool with the `--go_out` option, and the `--persist_out` options set to the same directory.

## Installation
This project requires [protoc](https://github.com/google/protobuf) and [protoc-gen-go](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial) be installed

Then install with ```go get github.com/tcncloud/protoc-gen-persist```
## Documentation
documentation for the project can be found [Here](docs/index.md)
The documentation goes over the persist options, how to structure your proto file,
custom type mapping to/from the database, and spanner query parsing

## NOTE: This project is under development, use it at your own risk!

## Version 2.0.0
- new method for generating before and after hooks. See #82 (@iamneal)

## Version 1.0.0
- new persist_lib generated package for custom handlers
- generated service handlers and custom handlers can be on different types,
in different packages
- expanded default type mapping
- lots of bug fixes

## Roadmap
 1. ~~type mapping~~
 1. ~~before & after callback function~~
 1. add tests, lots of tests
 1. ~~rewrite hooks/type mappings system to be more import safe~~
